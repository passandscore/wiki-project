<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Implemented a CRUD based Web application (SPA) that stores text based articles. If you are a guest user, then you are limited to view only access. User features include registration, login, logout, create, read, update and delete. All user authentication is handled on the server-side.


## What I learned 
I was able to take my knowlegde of CRUD applications and replicate a wiki page. This time around I found that I had minor challenges. Bootstrap and CSS would be the main hurdles that come to mind, although I am fairly happy with how it turned out. One day I will be a CSS pro, just wait for it. I was able to expand on Express with the utilization of Express-Session and Connect-Flash. These dependancies made the server-side validation process very smooth and I highly recommend them (see below). Futhermore, with Express-Validator I was able to streamline the error handling process with centralization. This may very well be the way I continue to handle errors with Express in the future. If I were to expand on this application I would start by introducing images.
